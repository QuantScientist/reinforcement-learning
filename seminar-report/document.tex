\section{Introduction}

In an age where a huge amount of information and news can be found
free-of-charge online, many content producers on the Internet rely on
advertisement revenues to fund their operations. Often this advertisement is
deployed in the form of clickable banner ads, either textual, graphical,
animated or even interactive content, usually separated from the main content,
and designed to attract the interest of visitors. When a visitor clicks such a
banner, they are redirected to the advertiser's site, and the content producer
is financially compensated for the referral.

In this kind of advertising, it is the interest of the content producer to
maximize \emph{click-through rate} (CTR) of the banner ads: the number of times
clicked divided by \emph{impressions}, the number of times shown. If a content
producer has several ad banners it could show to the user, one strategy could
be just to fill up the web site with ads. However this can quickly lead to user
annoyance, and in the worst scenario, cause users to leave the site. Further,
the effectiveness of the advertisements starts to wither as more slots for
banners are introduced, either because a saturation point is hit where users
learn to ignore most of the banners, or there simply is not room for more
banners on the page.

An alternative strategy is to recognize that there is a limit to the number of
viable banner slots, and attempt to somehow selectively choose the ads to show
according to whom the ad is being displayed to. This is often referred to as
\emph{targeted advertising} or \emph{behavioral targeting}. By adding some
intelligence, we can attempt to show the user advertisements he or she could
potentially be interested in instead of just uniformly picking one out of a
bunch.

This paper introduces two approaches to targeted advertising. First the
simpler, multi-armed bandit model is explored in some detail. It is the classic
example through which the exploration vs.  exploitation trade-off has been
studied. We then delve into some modifications of the model that are useful in
this setting of banner ad selection. After going through this simple model, a
more complex approach called reinforcement learning is considered. This
approach allows us to take into consideration situations in which the agent,
the ad system, can affect the state of the user, e.g. make them annoyed so that
they leave the site.

\section{Related work}

Other approaches to targeted advertising have been explored as well. Chen et
al. \cite{chen2009large} consider a Poisson regression model to predict
click-through rates from user history.  They applied their large-scale
parallelized approach to Yahoo's user base which resulted in great improvement
in CTR.

Work in information retrieval may be applied to targeted advertising as well.
For example personalized news recommendation is in some sense a very similar
problem, albeit from a different viewpoint. \emph{Contextual advertising} is
also concerned with selecting banner ads intelligently, but instead of
targeting the user, the ad is chosen according to the content being served to
the user.

A different but domain-related topic is learning strategies for
\emph{real-time bidding}. Currently web sites can sell ads for banner slots at
an extremely granular level: a single impression. When a user visits a site, a
few hundred millisecond auction is held, in which the advertisers name their
price given the profile of the visiting user. When the time is up, the highest
bidder gets their ad on the site. There have been studies on optimal strategies
for maximizing profits (i.e. balancing ad click-rate and cost) from the
viewpoint of the advertiser with \cite{ding2013multi} and without
\cite{chakraborty2010selective} the multi-armed bandit model. In any case, the
exploration vs exploitation dilemma is highlighted in this setting.

The quite recent field of applying computer science to ad selection goes under
the umbrella term \emph{computational advertising}. Especially software
corporations Microsoft and Yahoo conduct applied research in this field, while
the National Institute of Statistical Science (NISS) held a workshop on the
topic in 2009. % wikipedia

\section{Approaches}

Depending upon what kind of aspects of the problem we wish to take into
consideration, we may either consider targeted advertising through the simpler
bandit approach, or, the more complex full reinforcement learning approach. The
first approach is limited to immediate rewards while the second can learn from
delayed rewards, i.e. rewards that are not necessarily received immediately
after performing an action \cite{silver2013concurrent}. The reinforcement
learning approach can also capture effects the ad displayer (the agent) has
on the user (the state), for example user attrition caused by an offensive ad.

% Why important the above?


\subsection{Contextual bandit}

In the standard $n$-armed bandit problem, we are facing a slot machine with $n$
levers. Each lever is associated with some distinct probability distribution
that determines the amount of reward received from pulling that lever. Assuming
that pulling a lever is free, but that we have a limited number of pulls, how
do we maximize the expected total reward given that we do not know the
underlying distributions? \cite{book}

In the above situation, the \emph{exploration vs. exploitation} dilemma is
highlighted. After playing for a bit, we may get a sense that some lever has
rewarded us better than the rest based on our experience so far. Do we, then,
greedily continue playing that arm till the end, \emph{exploiting} our current
knowledge? Or should we still \emph{explore} the other levers, in case we have
had bad luck and another lever has better payout in the long run? These are the
questions that bandit algorithms attempt to answer in an optimal way.

We are especially interested in a generalization of the $n$-armed bandit
problem, namely the \emph{contextual multi-armed bandit}
\cite{langford2007epoch}, in which we receive some side-information, a context,
before having to choose the lever to pull. The setting has been outlined below.

\begin{itemize}
  \item[]
    \textbf{For} $t = 1, ..., T$ (rounds)
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item{Receive some context $x_t$.}
      \item{Choose action  $a_i$ (pull lever), where $i \in \setof{1,...,n}$.}
      \item{Receive reward $r_t \in \mathbb{R}$.}
    \end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

It should be stated that even though at first glance the multi-armed bandit
may seem like a very contrived problem, it is actually a very general
framework. In the case of targeted advertising, one way to adapt this model
is as follows.  The agent making the decisions is the website. The levers to
pull are all the possible ads that can be shown in a banner slot. The reward
received is 1 if a user clicks the ad, and 0 otherwise. The context is some
information gathered on the user, e.g. what pages they have visited, gender,
interests, age and so on. A more complex reward function could also be
considered, in which the reward received depends, for example, on which ad is
being displayed.

\subsubsection{Thompson sampling}
Thompson sampling \cite{chapelle2011empirical} is an algorithm to address the
exploitation vs. exploration trade-off in the contextual multi-armed bandit
case. The idea is that we have a probability distribution on the arms denoting
the probability that each is optimal. In each round, we sample these
distributions so as to choose the next lever to pull. The distributions are
then updated according to rewards experienced.

Thompson sampling can be understood in the Bayesian context as follows. Denote
previous observations of contexts, pulls and rewards as $D = \setof{(x_i, a_i,
r_i) \;|\; i \in \mathbb{N}}$. These are modeled using a likelihood function
$P(r \;|\; a,x,\theta)$, where $\theta$ are some parameters. The posterior
distribution of the parameters is given by the Bayes rule, namely $P(\theta |
D) \propto \prod P(r_i | a_i, x_i, \theta) P(\theta)$, given prior $P(\theta)$.

Assuming we knew the true parameters $\theta^*$, we would ideally choose the
lever that maximizes expected reward $\arg\max_a E[r | a, x, \theta^*]$. In
reality we do not know the true parameters. Instead, we must integrate over the
domain of the parameters $\theta$, obtaining $\arg\max_a \int E[r | a, x,
\theta] P(\theta|D) d\theta$. However this corresponds to only exploitation
\cite{chapelle2011empirical}.

Taking exploration into consideration as well, the following equation is
obtained: the probability of choosing to perform pull $a$ is given by
\begin{equation}
  \int \mathbb{I}\bigg[E[r|a,x,\theta] = \max_{a'}
  E\big[r|a',x,\theta\big]\bigg] P(\theta | D) d\theta,
\end{equation}

where $\mathbb{I}$ is an indicator function that obtains value 1 when its
condition is true and zero when it is not.  This integral is not directly
computed, instead Algorithm~\ref{alg:thompson} is used to the same effect.

\begin{algorithm}
  \caption{Thompson sampling \cite{chapelle2011empirical}}
  \label{alg:thompson}
  \begin{algorithmic}[1]
    \State $D := \emptyset$
    \For{$t=1,...,T$}
      \State Receive context $x_t$.
      \State Draw $\theta^t$ according to $P(\theta | D)$.
      \State Select $a_t := \arg\max_a E[r | x_t, a, \theta^t]$.
      \State Observe reward $r_t$.
      \State $D = D \cup (x_t, a_t, r_t)$.
    \EndFor
  \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

Let us illustrate this idea with the help of an example. Assume the standard
$n$-armed bandits situation, in which each lever $i \in [1,n]$ is distributed
according to a Bernoulli distribution with success probability $\theta^*_i$.
This is equivalent to a biased coin flip, in which heads ($r=1$) is observed
with probability $\theta^*_i$ and tails ($r=0$) with probability $1 -
\theta^*_i$.

For each arm $i$, we maintain a separate Beta distribution modeling our belief
of what the arm's success probability (or CTR) is. In mathematical terms, if
$X_i$ is the random variable corresponding to the reward received (coin flip,
click or not, 0 or 1) from pulling the $i$:th lever, then $X_i \sim
\text{Bernoulli}(\theta^*_i)$, and we estimate $E[X_i] \sim \text{Beta}(S_i +
1, F_i + 1)$, where $S_i$ is the number of successes and $F_i$ is the number of
failures observed for the $i$:th arm so far. The Beta distribution is used
because it is the conjugate prior of the Bernoulli likelihood, a concept from
Bayesian probability theory that roughly states that the posterior distribution
stays in the same family as the prior distribution. Furthermore, the math works
out in an intuitive sense.

This example is applied as Algorithm~\ref{alg:thompson} as follows. We
initialize $S_i := F_i := 0$ for all arms. Line 3 can be ignored because we are
not considering context. Line 4 is performed so that each arm's Beta
distribution is sampled.  The arm with the largest sample is pulled, and its
respective success or failure counter is updated after receiving the reward.
This is equivalent to the posterior update on Line 7.  The pseudocode for this
Bernoulli case has been outlined in Algorithm~\ref{alg:thompson-bandit}.

      \State Draw $\theta_i \sim \text{Beta}(S_i + \alpha, F_i + \beta)$
      (sample each arm).
      \EndFor
      \State Draw arm $\hat{i} := \arg\max_{i} \theta_i$ (with largest sample) and observe reward $r$.

      \Else

How a Beta distribution, conveying our belief on click probability for an arm,
can look like, is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:beta}. Shown is the history of
a Beta distribution for a single arm. Naturally, each arm would have a history
of Beta distributions running parellel to the one shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:beta}.

From left to right of Figure~\ref{fig:beta}, we start off with the initial
situation in which no observations have yet been done. The uniform prior,
$\alpha = \beta = 1$, is used so that each success probability $\theta^*_i$ is
believed to be equally likely.

The second plot shows how the distribution looks like after we have observed
one click of the respective ad. Our beliefs shift towards higher click-through
rates. In the third plot, 6 clicks and 3 non-clicks have been recorded.
Non-clicks cause the distribution to shift a bit leftwards towards lower CTR.
The final figure shows how the distributions looks like after 300 clicks and 60
non-clicks. We see how the distribution sharpens --- it is more confident that
the 'true' CTR lays at about $300 / 360 \approx 0.833$.

rates. Then 5 clicks ($r=1$, successes) and 2 non-clicks ($r=0$, failures) are
recorded. The final situation to the very right shows what the distribution
looks like after 300 clicks and 60 non-clicks.}
  \label{fig:beta}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:beta} highlights the situation for only a single arm (ad).
Each ad will have a respective series of Beta distributions according to
history of clicks observed. At round $t$ we sample each ad's current
distribution, as in Lines 3-5 of Algorithm~\ref{alg:thompson-bandit}, and show
the ad with the highest sample. This means that in the long run, when the
distributions settle on some peaks, the algorithm will start to exploit.
However there is still randomness involved, and occasionally, other ads will be
shown as well, and their respective distributions updated.

The parameters to tinker with in this situation are the priors $\alpha$ and
$\beta$. They can be set uniquely for each distribution to model our prior
belief that some ads will be clicked on more than others, if, we have a strong
conviction that such is the case. Chapelle et al. \cite{chapelle2011empirical}
note that even with prior mismatches, Thompson sampling works well. Thus the
defaults are often good enough in practice.

We can also reshape the posterior distributions to be more sharp, thereby
favoring exploitation, or, we can widen them to favor exploration. The latter
may be useful in situations where the distributions are highly nonstationary.
For example, in the ad banner domain, it may be that users get tired of the
same ads being displayed over a long period of time. Perhaps some big news
event happens and suddenly users are interested in clicking an ad that used to
be uninteresting to them. Hence estimated sharp click-through rates are no
longer acccurate, and more uncertainty should be introduced in the form of
widening the posteriors.

In the example above, we did not consider context.  To use contexts in this
Thompson setting, we need a separate distribution for each ad and user profile
pair. Not surprisingly then, if the number of ads, and especially, if the
number of possible user profiles is too high, we need a huge set (possibly of
infinite cardinality) of distributions. What follows easily is that we
encounter a situation, where there are too many parameters to learn reliably.
There are ways to combat this as will be seen in
Section~\ref{sec:function_approximation}.

While the presented approach is Bayesian, it is not fully Bayesian like the
Gittins index, which although is Bayes-optimal, can not be implemented
efficiently in practice \cite{chapelle2011empirical}. The downside of Thompson
sampling is that there is a lack of theoretical analysis. Chapelle et al.
\cite{chapelle2011empirical}, however, demonstrate empirically that it
outperforms UCB \cite{auer2002finite} and $\epsilon$-greedy methods in certain
cases.

One such case is delayed feedback which is central to ad display. We may
not process the rewards immediately because of runtime or user constraints,
e.g. system is not fast enough or user does not immediately click on ad when on
page. The feedback might be processes in batches between which lay a long
amount of time. Thompson sampling alleviates the problem of delayed feedback by
randomization over actions, while deterministic UCB suffers large regret when
it gets locked on to a suboptimal choice.

% TODO: what cases?

\subsubsection{Mortal bandits}
Most often in online advertisement, the ads (the levers) have a limited
lifespans due to limited budgets, seasonal holiday campaigns, and other
uncontrollable factors. On the other hand, new levers are introduced
occasionally in the form of new ad campaigns. This results in a stark
contradiction between reality and our model, because the multi-armed bandit
model assumes implicitly that its levers are in existence indefinitely
\cite{chakrabarti2008mortal}.

Chakrabarti et al. \cite{chakrabarti2008mortal} introduce algorithms for mortal
multi-armed bandits, a model in which levers regularly die and new ones come to
existence as replacements. One of the main results they derive is that the
regret bounds for such a situation can not be as low as for the non-mortal
case. Instead of $O(\ln t)$, a bound of $\Omega(t)$ is achieved under
mortality, $t$ being the number of rounds.

One of the main reasons for the worse bound is that in the non-mortal scenario,
after finding an optimal arm, the algorithm can thereafter concentrate on
indefinite exploitation. When arms are subject to lifetimes, such nonchalance
is out of the question.  An especially challenging case arises when there are
many levers and short lifespans. Most likely, one must settle for suboptimality
in such a case.

The paper \cite{chakrabarti2008mortal} also describes how standard multi-armed
bandits can be adapted to take mortality into account. This is needed so that
the algorithms do not spend too much time on exploration, an investment that is
not justified under mortality. The idea of the \emph{subset heuristic} is to
divide the rounds into epochs. At the dawn of each epoch, we choose a subset
of arms uniformly at random from the set of all arms. We then run the standard
multi-armed bandit algorithm on the subset until the end of the epoch.

The classical, standard multi-armed algorithm, UCB1 \cite{auer2002finite}, is
extended to allow for mortality. Whether or not the heuristic has been applied
to contextual bandits and Thompson sampling is something the author of this
seminar report could not find material on. However, on the surface, there seems
to be no forbidding factors.

\subsection{Reinforcement learning}

Sometimes we may need an approach that captures more than what the $n$-armed
bandits can offer. Reinforcement learning generalizes the scenario of $n$-armed
bandits by considering a more inclusive model. We will first look at how the
full reinforcement problem can be formulated as a Markov decision process. We
will then examine some algorithms for learning optimal policies for these
processes under additional challenges brought by the banner ad domain.


\subsubsection{MDP}

A Markov decision process (MDP) \cite{book} is a 4-tuple
\begin{equation}
  (S, A, \setof{P_a : S \times S \rightarrow [0,1] \,|\, a \in A},
  \setof{R_a : S \times S \rightarrow \mathbb{R} \,|\, a \in A}).
\end{equation}

Above $S$ is a finite set of states. $A$ is a finite set of actions. Function
$P_a(s, s')$ gives the probability of transitioning to state $s'$ after
performing action $a$ in state $s$. The reward function $R_a : S \times S
\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ gives the immediate reward obtained from performing
action $a$ in state $s$ and ending up in $s'$.

The simulation is started from an initial state $s_0$ at time 0. During each
discrete time step $t$, we are in some state $s_t$, on the basis of which we
must choose an action $a_t$, after which we are rewarded $r_t \in \mathbb{R}$,
time $t$ is incremented by one, and we end up at state $s_{t+1}$
\cite{abe2002empirical}. The task is called \emph{episodic} if there are end
states, after which the simulation is restarted. Otherwise we call the task
\emph{continuing} \cite{book}.

The central problem here, then, is to find a (near) optimal policy $\pi$ for
the agent performing the actions. Given we are in state $s_t \in S$, $\pi(s_t)$
indicates the action $a_t$ that should be performed. (This can be a probability
distribution defined on set of all actions $A$.) The optimal policy we wish to
find is the one that maximizes the reward accumulated over time, put formally,
maximizes $\sum_{t=0}^\infty \gamma^t R_{a_t}(s_t, s_{t+1})$, where $\gamma \in
[0,1)$ is the discount rate.

In the reinforcement learning setting, we do not know the transition
probabilities $P_a$ or the reward functions $R_a$ in advance. This entails that
in order to find an optimal policy---solve the \emph{control problem}---we
must also solve the \emph{prediction problem}, or in some sense, estimate the
transition probabilities and rewards. We do this by means of estimating a value
function.

Given a policy $\pi$, the value function $Q^\pi(s,a)$ indicates the
desirability of taking action $a$ in state $s$. The desirability is the
expected value of the cumulative reward given that we start in state $s$ and
take action $a$, after which we strictly follow policy $\pi$. The formulation
is given below, in which $r_{t+k+1}$ denotes the reward procured during time
$t+k+1$.

\begin{equation}
  Q^\pi(s,a) = E_\pi \big[ \sum_{k=0}^\infty \gamma^k r_{t+k+1} \;|\; s_t = s,
  a_t = a\big],
\end{equation}

The value function $Q^*$ of an optimal policy $\pi^*$ satisfies the
\emph{Bellman optimality equation},

\begin{equation}
  Q^*(s,a) = E\big[r_{t+1} \;|\; s_t = s, a_t = a\big]
  + \gamma E\big[\max_{a'} Q^*(s_{t+1}, a') \;|\; s_t = s, a_t = a\big]
\end{equation}

A value function $Q$ implicitly characterizes a policy. The policy is to always
choose the action that maximizes the value function, or, $\pi(s) = \arg\max_a
Q(s,a)$. In the case of optimal value function $Q^*$, following this method
leads to the optimal policy $\pi^*$ \cite{abe2002empirical}.

%TODO: more on value function?

The standard multi-armed bandit can be viewed as a Markov decision process in
which there is exactly one state. The levers of the bandit are all the possible
actions, and performing an action always brings you back to the initial state.
The contextual bandit model does have different states, but the action chosen
doesn't impact the choice of the next state.

\subsection{Function approximation}
\label{sec:function_approximation}
Almost all the implementations \cite{abe2002empirical, silver2013concurrent,
chapelle2011empirical} of targeted advertising considered in this seminar
report required some sort of function approximation, regardless of whether they
were bandit or reinforcement based.

In real world (advertisement) data there tends to be a huge amount of features,
which means that if we treat the state space of the reinforcement learning
problem as the feature space, we get a huge explosion in the number of states
\cite{abe2002empirical}.  This means that most likely the reinforcement
learning will not know how to behave desirably in never-before-seen states
\cite{book}.
